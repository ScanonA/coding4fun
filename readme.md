What is this?
This is the green-bin. A rewards program, and mini-tomagotchi game, where you can clean up the environment of the poor penguin.
Ideally, there would be a micro-bottle Depo, which would immediately give you your bottle deposits back, however due to lack of hardware and time this was excluded from our goals.

The locations of the local bottle depos is available in the app itself inside one of the apps menus and promotes a system of leaderboards where users can compare with other users how their recycling points stack against others.
